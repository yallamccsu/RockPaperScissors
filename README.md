# Rock Paper Scissors Game (Simulated Players)

This is a Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where both Player 1 and Player 2 are simulated using random choices. The user chooses how many rounds to play, and the program tracks the score and announces the overall winner at the end.

## Features

- Simulates two players using random choices
- Plays multiple rounds based on user input
- Determines round winners using classic RPS rules
- Tracks and displays scores for Player 1, Player 2, and ties
- Outputs an overall winner or tie at the end

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder with the file.
